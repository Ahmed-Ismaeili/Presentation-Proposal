# Performing Robots presentation

My presentation revolves around the Hanson Robotics robot, Sophia. Sophia is social humanoid robot that has been featured on a plethora of talk shows, speeches and even is a citizen of Saui Arabia!

One interesting thing about Sophia is her obviously robotic limbs and the choice of clearly presenting the circuitry within her head by leaving it open, rather than covering it up. This aspect of her reflects the an emotion often brought up during robotic performances, the uncanny valley effect, which is the discomfort we feel when the resemblance of the robot to real life is almost perfect, but still almost. Sophia's aesthetic avoids this feeling by making her humanoid, but still clearly depicted her robotic characteristics.

The video I chose to present is Sophia's special appearence on Jimmy Fallon's The Late Night Show wherein she holds a solid conversation with him and even plays rock paper scissors with him, making jokes along the way. One compelling feature of the video was that there was not necessarily on averacrhing story, rather, was a series of short entertaining bits all displaying the functionality of the robot. I was inspired by this becuase it meant that instead of telling a theatrical story, Robotic performance could be a showcase of functionality, like a talent show rather than being tied down by a narrative that would have to be followed.

# Idea Proposal

My idea for the final presentation is to make a real life replica of the Disney Pixar character Wall-e. This image is a complex recreation of the animated Robot.

My Wall-e Robot would be much simpler and would:
1) Have servos that would control
- Both arms
- (potentially the hands that just open and close, without fingers and a Trap door like body opening)
- Eyes movement (servos within light foam, board "head")
- Eyebrows
2) Motors that would allow the wall-e bot to drive around (potentially shaping them like tracks rather than just wheels)
3) Able to make sounds and play music through in built speakers (either autonomous or controlled via bluetooth)

I would like to make a fully autonomous performance reminiscent of the opening scenes of the movie Wall-e, re-telling the classic story however, I am also open to having a controlled Wall-e or at last, remote controlled/ dependant aspects as well.
